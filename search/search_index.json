Using ChainAPI, API providers can configure and deploy an Airnode which links their API data to several blockchains. Airnode is designed with mechanisms that eliminate both on-chain and off-chain concerns of API providers. The set-and-forget framework of Airnode is all about its ease of implementation.</p> <p>ChainAPI can connect almost any API, whether open or authenticated, to Airnode. Airnode then queries your API operations to be consumed by EVM on-chain smart contracts, either by using the request/response protocol or the more popular on-chain dAPI sets.</p> <p>Use the ChainAPI web based app to get started. The app will step you through the process. If needed, there are helpful hints in the User Guides of the ChainAPI documents. There are two primary functions of the app:</p> <ul> <li>Integrate: Creates and maintain a <code>config.json</code> file that defines an Airnode.</li> <li>Deploy: Deploys the Airnode to a cloud provider, AWS or GCP.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The ChainAPI web based app creates an Airnode configuration file that is used to deploy an Airnode to either AWS or GCP. The deployment process uses <code>config.json</code> parameters to build the Airnode. Airnode bootstraps itself using attributes from <code>config.json</code>.</p>"},{"location":"guides/accounts/","title":"Accounts","text":"<p>ChainAPI identifies you through a wallet you own by way of MetaMask.

An HTTP request is made by a client, to a named host, which is located on a server. The aim of the request is to access a resource on the server. There is a more secure version called HTTPS. HTTPS is commonly used to access REST API resources using endpoint declarations in a URL.</p>"},{"location":"reference/terms/#integration","title":"Integration","text":"<p>A connection between two services.
